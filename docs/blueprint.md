# **App Name**: BrewFlow POS

## Core Features:

- Sales Transactions: Enable basic POS functionality including item selection, order total calculation, and payment processing (cash only for MVP). Offline mode support is critical, with data synchronization when back online.
- Inventory Management: Implement basic inventory tracking: add/remove items, and view current stock levels. No support for vendor management in the MVP. Data should sync across branches when online.
- Daily Sales Report: Generate a simple end-of-day sales report with total sales, and a summary of transactions. Allow exporting as a text file that can be emailed.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Warm coffee brown (#6F4E37) to evoke a sense of comfort and coffee.
- Secondary color: Creamy beige (#F5F5DC) for backgrounds and text contrast.
- Accent: Teal (#008080) for buttons and interactive elements, providing a modern touch.
- Clean and readable fonts for clarity in transaction details and reports.
- Simple, minimalist icons for product categories and actions.
- Intuitive and uncluttered layout for easy navigation, even during busy periods.
